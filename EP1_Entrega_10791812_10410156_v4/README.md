# EP1
This assignment purpose was to take as input a tridiagonal matrix and find its eigenvalue and eigenvector through the use of the QR algorithm. It has different test scenarios from which it compares the number of iterations k with and without the wilkinson shift for the same matrix and a given problem where it applies the algorithm in a mass-spring system and plots the system response in Position vs Time.

# EP2

This assignment adds up to the first one through an algorithm that takes a symmetric matrix and transforms it into a tridiagonal symetric matrix that then can be inputed into the QR alogrithm. It does that using the HouseHolder method. It has two test scenarios and one problem application which consists in a 2D treliss. The files input-a and input-b may be used as input in the test scenarios and input-c must be used as input in the problem application.

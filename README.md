# MAP3121-Numerical-Methods-and-Applications
Two course assignments called EP1 and EP2. They are algorithms to manipulate tridiagonal symmetric matrices, finding their eigenvalues and eigenvectors and applying them in different problem scnearios. Note that the EP1 project was one of the first projects in python I've ever made and therefore the code is quite cumbersome and not "pythonic".
